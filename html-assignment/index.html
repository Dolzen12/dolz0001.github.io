 <p>  My name is Dolzen.  I was born on 5<sup>th</sup> june 2003. I am 20 years old. I passed my high school in India from Kamla Nehru Public School. I plan to study in Canada for my bright future, so I came in Canada for good education. I have taken <abbr title="Interactive Media Design ">IMD </abbr> (Interactice media design) Winter term 2024. </p>

 <p> Talking about my interest, I love to listen music and doing heena art, i also like to do painting. Painting make me feel clam and whenever i paint i feel stressed out. I love English songs. My favourite singer is Justin bieber. I am his big fan. One more thing i like the most is that i love cook South Indian food. </p>
