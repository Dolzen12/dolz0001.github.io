                Talking about my interest, I love to listen music and doing heena art, i also like to do painting. Painting make me feel clam and whenever i paint i feel stressed out. I love English songs. My favourite singer is Justin bieber. I am his big fan. One more thing i like the most is that i love cook South Indian food.
